This is an interactive dashboard to model Recovery through Waterflood and different EOR techniques. We can perform Economic Analysis based on different Production Profiles by generating Petroleum Project Net Cash Flows (NCF), Net Present Value (NPV),
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and different plots for Sensitivity Analysis through Tornado Charts and Spider Plots based on given CAPEX, OPEX, Tax, Royalty, and Oil Prices.
